# CS3283/4 Registration

## Before you register

Before you register for the module, please form a team of 4-5 students (strict limit).  Since registration is done manually, please make sure that:

* Everyone has completed CS2103, which is the essential prerequisite for CS3283/4.
* There is no timetable clash with the CS3283/4 lecture slot (Fri 4-6pm)
* Each team is expected to spend significant amount of time working together (10 hours per week).  Team members should compare timetables to ensure that there is sufficient overlaps between the free time for this to happen.

If you are solo or have a team of less than the required number of students, you can go the IVLE forum [Let's Team Up](https://ivle.nus.edu.sg/v1/forum/forum.aspx?ForumID=5f2351f0-80e0-45ca-ae32-b131095eeadc) to find other students interested in the module.

* Team dynamics can make or break a project.  Please form a team with others that you are comfortable working with.
* It is better to form a team where team members have complimentary interests, experience, and skills.
* Take a look at the avialable projects, and talk among yourselves to see which one you are interested in.  If you are going to spend 20 hours working on the project, it should be something that you at least feel some interest in.
* You can also propose your own project.  If you are interested in doing that, please pitch it to your potential teammates as well.

Once you form a team that has common interests in a project, complimentary skills/experience/interests, and are comfortable working with each other, please choose a name for your team.  You will need it to register.
